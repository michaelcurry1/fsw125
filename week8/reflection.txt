My Reflection Assignment,

I thought this course was very demanding. I am totally still comprehending it all. T he teaching was very limited alot of do it yourself. I t shows you how demanding and stressful this can be. I made it this far. Yeah!

I definitely understand front end an d backend better. and how to use postman also.

I am proud that I am still here in the trenches trudging away and thanks to all the AC's they help so much.

thank you
